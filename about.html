                    <p>
                        Other than the ability to use English fluently, our guides have a great sense of humor and
                        outstanding character.
                        And with the mix of their historical backgrounds (which are absolutely outstanding) they filter
                        interesting stories from dull ones,
                        read the audience and adapt to unforesseen events.

                        Every guide has a strong suit, so depending on your tour you will get a guide with an according

                        <b>Hrvoje “Harry”</b><br>
                        My name is a typical Croatian name; Hrvoje, but seeing as how most people have difficulties
                        pronouncing it, my guests have dubbed me “Harry” (sometimes Harry Potter, sometimes Prince
                        Harry, but most of the time it is Dirty Harry, and of course, I am certain that you will “make
                        my day”). I have been a tour guide since 2009 and when I first started out at the age of 18 I
                        was by far the youngest guide in Split. I am licensed for three regions, I have a Master’s
                        degree in English and German and I do tours in over 40 locations. When I am not guiding private
                        tours for Harry’s Tour, I work for numerous local and international companies (Tauck, Grand
                        Circle, Viking, Road Scholar, Silver Sea and many others). Being a tour guide is not just my
                        main profession, but a lifestyle. Most of my family and friends work in tourism and we share the
                        idea of lifelong learning. I love sharing my knowledge with my guests in an entertaining way. We
                        can cover all there is to know and have a lot of fun while doing so.

                        <b>Ajlin</b><br>
                        My name has a bit of an Irish flavour to it; “Eileen”, but I am as local as they get. I was born
                        and raised in Split and have been a tour guide for the entirety of my adult life.In addition to
                        guiding, I work as a high school teacher of English and German. I have lived through the
                        Communist era of tourism and the post-Homeland war period. I have three decades of experience
                        and have worked with all of the bigger companies that come to my home town. I enjoy doing
                        private tours and sharing stories with my guests about whatever might interest them.Whether you
                        would like to hear fascinating tales of life in Communist Yugoslavia, discuss the complex topic
                        of the Homeland war in the 90s, hear about life in Croatia today or explore ancient and medieval
                        history, I would be more than happy to give you insight into these topics. Croatia is a
                        wonderful new destination and I would be happy to show you some of its secrets.

                        <b>Tina</b><br>
                        My name is Tina and currently I am pursuing a Master’s degree in English and Italian. I obtained
                        my guiding license at a very young age and have been extremely satisfied with my profession ever
                        since. I am very fortunate to have been born just a few minutes on foot from the ancient Roman
                        palace in Split. Looking back at my childhood, I find it incredible that, as a child, I played
                        hide and seek in a palace which is 1700 hundred years old. Therein lies the beauty of Split, it
                        is not just a series of rocks, standing in absolute silence. No, quite the opposite, the stories
                        of Split echo from the timeless stone and new stories are embedded each day. How unique is it to
                        find a Roman palace, which is fully inhabited? I invite you to see Split through my eyes. This
                        is my passion, showing you the beauties of Dalmatia; and Split is just the beginning. Join me
                        and together we will explore all that this remarkable region has to offer.

                        <b>Sandra</b><br>
                        Hello! I am Sandra from Split, Croatia. I am a teacher of English and Italian, but also a tour
                        guide for Split and Šibenik region. I love dancing, singing, reading books, spending time in
                        nature, but most of all, I adore travelling abroad! If you are very passionate about exploring
                        Split and its surroundings, I think you would agree that the best way to do it would be with a
                        fellow traveller. I am always ready to present my home region in an interesting and interactive
                        way. So, if you genuinely want to learn more about Dalmatia and create lasting memories, then do
                        not hesitate to join me on an adventure. Experience Croatia with a professional, licensed local
                        guide. I like to think that Croatia is the new exotic; everybody has been to Italy and Greece,
                        but only a select few can boast that they have explored Croatia. Other than being a hidden gem,
                        the Dalmatian coast is affordable, safe and full of excitement and activities. See you very
                        soon!
