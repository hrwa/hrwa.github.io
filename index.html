                    <h3>Archeological Museum</h3>

                    <p>
                        Incredible collection of sarcophagi, tools, tombstones, jewellery, weapons, coins and mosaics
                        found within the archaeological site of Salona. It focuses mostly on the Roman influence,
                        although there are exhibits from the Greek, Illyrian and Asia Minor cultures.
                    </p>

                <li class="icon fa-user-circle-o">
                    <h3>Meštrović Gallery</h3>

                    <p>
                        Learn the story of the artist who shaped contemporary Yugoslavian art, through the gallery,
                        yet to see his entire opus one would have to spend quite some time travelling through the various
                        former Yugoslav countries and exploring countless cities, as Meštrović’s work is present in many
                        of the more popular towns, landscapes, villages and cities of ex-Yugoslavia.
                    </p>

                <li class="icon fa-tint">
                    <h3>Krka & Šibenik</h3>

                    <p>
                        The trinity of senses: the smell of fresh air, the awe inspiring beauty that you can see wherever
                        you look and the sound of water crashing against the rocks. It is no surprise that frequent
                        guests of Croatia visit and revisit the national park constantly.

                    <h3>Salona</h3>

                    <p>
                        If you like history, this is definitely the tour for you. Explore a ruin city that was once the
                        great capital of the Roman province of Dalmatia and had 60,000 people in the 2nd century AD.
                    </p>

                <li class="icon fa-ship">
                    <h3>Split</h3>

                    <p>
                        Split is definitely the highlight of the region and without this city it is highly unlikely that any
                        other gems of Central Dalmatia would have been discovered. The entire old town of Split is under
                        UNESCO protection, but the focus of our tour is the ancient palace itself.

                <li class="icon fa-sun-o">
                    <h3>Trogir</h3>

                    <p>
                        Trogir will allow you to see a lot, without walking too much. Trogir is a maze in which people
                        love to get lost. Every street will offer a new photo opportunity, every building is of
                        architectural interest. It is no wonder that this is the case, since Trogir was a city of
                        nobility who built magnificent palaces in their home town.
